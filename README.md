I am an aspiring engineer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in engineering, object-oriented programming, and machine learning.

My passion lies in solving business problems with tailored data and algorithms and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver high-performing solutions.

In my undergraduate studies, I‚Äôve taken on various leadership roles, including various team projects, Organized hackathons, events and conducted workshops reaching over 300+ students.
